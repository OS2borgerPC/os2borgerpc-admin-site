This directory contains the BibOS Admin system, which is a remote
administration system for Debian-based GNU/Linux-systems, especially
Ubuntu systems.

The system is developed for a number of public libraries in Denmark and was
specifically designed to manage their BibOS systems for audience PC. Its
functionality aims to be similar to that of Canonical's Landscape
product, but less ambitious.

The system was prepared by Magenta Aps: See http://www.magenta-aps.dk
