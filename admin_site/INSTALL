In *this* directory enter:

./scripts/install.sh

If a virtualenv from a previous installation already exists, the install
script will abort. Please clean this up first by doing a

rm -rf bin/ lib/ local/ include/

If this is a completely fresh installation, initialize the database by
doing

python manage.py syncdb

Now run 

python manage.py runserver 8080

And you will be able to access the system at http://localhost:8080.
