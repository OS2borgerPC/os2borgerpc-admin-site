  <h1>{% translate "Power saving functions" %}</h1>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The power saving functions consist of a suspend script and on/off schedules.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The suspend script is only intended for use on OS2borgerPC while the on/off
    schedules can be used on both OS2borgerPC and OS2borgerPC Kiosk. The suspend
    script can be combined with on/off schedules.

  <h2>{% translate "The suspend script" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The suspend script can be used to configure computers to automatically suspend
    after a number of minutes of inactivity. A chosen warning is displayed before
    the computer is suspended. The script takes five arguments: whether to
    activate the function, the number of minutes of inactivity before the warning
    is shown, the number of minutes of inactivity before the computer suspends,
    the text in the warning and the text on the button in the warning. If the
    last two text-related inputs are left empty, default texts will be used.
    The script automatically logs out the user before the computer suspends.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The suspend script can also suspend the computer when it is inactive on the
    login screen. However, this requires that script execution at login has been
    enabled via the script
    {% endblocktranslate %}
    <a href="{% url 'script_redirect_id' '1064' %}">Udfases - Slå scriptkørsel ved login til/fra</a>.
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    Script execution at login is automatically enabled on image 5.0.0 and newer images.
    The warning will not be shown on the login screen.

  <h2>{% translate "On/Off schedules" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    An on/off schedule is a tool for planning and administrating on and off
    times for computers in one or more groups.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% translate "The use of On/Off schedules makes it unnecessary to use the scripts" %}

  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    When you click on "On/Off schedule" in the left-hand menu, a list of schedules
    for the chosen site will be shown to the right of the left-hand menu. You
    can click on a particular schedule in order to edit that schedule.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The editing interface for the chosen schedule is shown on the right. If no
    schedules have been created for the chosen site, the interface for creating
    schedules will be shown instead.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    When you click on a schedule, you will by default be shown the schedule's
    settings as well as the exceptions and groups that are associated with
    the schedule. Here you can change the schedule's name, status, sleep state
    and settings for the general week plan as well as add/remove groups or
    exceptions from the schedule. Changes do not take effect until you've
    clicked on the "Save changes"-button at the bottom of the screen.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    If you click on "Create closed days", "Create altered opening hours" or
    "Edit exceptions", you will be redirected to a new page where you can
    create new exceptions and edit or delete existing exceptions. The two
    "Create" buttons take you directly to an interface for that particular
    type of exception while "Edit exceptions" opens the editing interface
    for the first exception for the chosen site.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The different editing options are described more closely here:
    {% endblocktranslate %}
    {% include 'documentation/wake_plans/__submenu__.html' %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    If you wish to create a new schedule, you must click on "Add new
    On/Off schedule" above the list of schedules. This opens an interface
    where you must enter a name for the schedule and have the option of
    editing the settings and adding exceptions or groups. When you click
    on "Save changes", you will be redirected to the editing interface for
    the newly screated schedule where you can continue to edit the settings
    and add exceptions or groups. If the schedule status is set to "Active",
    it will also take effect when you click on "Save changes".
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h2>{% translate "Important information" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    A computer can only receive a new/updated schedule if it is on. If a
    computer is added to a schedule or its schedule is changed while it
    is off, it will only begin following the new/updated schedule once it
    has been on.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    If a computer is manually turned on after its off time or on a day where
    it is set to be constantly off, it will not turn off automatically until
    the off time for the next day. If no off time has been set for the next
    day, it will turn off automatically 24 hours after it was turned on. If
    the computer is turned off manually, it will turn on according to the
    schedule.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h3>{% translate "UEFI/BIOS settings" %}</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      If UEFI/BIOS has been set to turn on the computer at a specific time, and
      the computer belongs to an active On/Off schedule, then the computer
      will not turn on according to the on times in the schedule, but
      instead follow the times set in the UEFI/BIOS. It will, however, turn off
      according to the schedule. If you want the computer to follow the on
      times set in the schedule then you must enter UEFI/BIOS and disable the
      UEFI/BIOS control of on times. It is generally not possible to modify
      UEFI/BIOS from the OS so it cannot be done via scripts.
      {% endblocktranslate %}
    </li>
    <li>
      {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      If the computers temporarily lose power while they are turned off according
      to the schedule, they will still turn on according to the schedule.
      (So long as the CMOS battery is still charged.) However, if the computers
      lose power while they are on, they will not turn on automatically.
      {% endblocktranslate %}

      {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      Some UEFI/BIOS systems include the option to set the computer to return to its last state
      (or turn on) after a power failure. We recommend turning this option on.
      {% endblocktranslate %}

      {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      The layout may differ depending on the UEFI/BIOS version, but here is an example from a NUC:
      From the overview you choose "Advanced" and then "Power":
      {% endblocktranslate %}
      <img src="{% static 'docs/img/wake_plan/nuc_bios_start_page.jpg' %}" alt="">
      {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      Next, you edit the setting "After Power Failure" and set it to "Last State"
      (recommended) or "Power On".
      {% endblocktranslate %}
      <img src="{% static 'docs/img/wake_plan/nuc_bios_wake_up_power_failure_setting.jpg' %}" alt="">

  </ol>
  <h3>{% translate "Frequently asked questions" %}</h3>
  <h4>{% translate "1. How do I add a single PC to a schedule?" %}</h4>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    On/Off schedules are designed to work with groups, so it is not possible to
    directly add a single PC to a schedule. You can, however, always create
    a group that only contains that one PC and then add that group to the
    schedule.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
    </p>
  <h4>{% translate "2. What happens if the computer experiences a power failure?" %}</h4>
  <p>{% blocktranslate %}Check the second paragraph under "UEFI/BIOS settings" further up.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
  <h4>{% translate "3. The computer turns on and off at the wrong times?" %}</h4>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    This could be due to incorrect time settings on the computer, which could be caused
    by the computer being unable to perform time synchronization. Ubuntu Linux
    - and many other operating systems - normally performs time synchronization via the
    protocol NTP (Network Time Protocol). NTP runs on port 123 via UDP, which we thus
    suggest allowing in your network configuration. If you do not wish to allow
    this traffic on all domains, we could develop a script that forces NTP to
    only check specific URL's.
