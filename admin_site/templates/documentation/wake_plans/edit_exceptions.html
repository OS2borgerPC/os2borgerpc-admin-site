    On the page for handling schedule exceptions, a list of schedule exceptions
    for the chosen site will be shown to the right of the left-hand menu. You
    can click on the name of a particular exception in order to edit it.

    There are two types of exceptions: altered opening hours and closed days.
    The two types have different icons in the list of exceptions. An
    exception with altered opening hours changes the on and off times for the
    chosen date or period. The icon is an open door. An exception with closed
    days sets the associated devices to be constantly off during the chosen
    date or period. The icon is a closed door.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The editing interface for the chosen exception is shown to the right. If no
    exceptions have been created for the chosen site, the interface for creating
    an exception with altered opening hours will be shown instead.

    By default when you click on an exception, you will be shown the settings for
    the exception. Here, you can change the name of the exception and the period where
    it applies. A single date is chosen by choosing the same from and to date. If
    the exception has the type altered opening hours, it will also be possible to
    change the on and off time that applies during the exception. Changes do not
    become permanent until you have clicked on "Save changes" at the bottom of the screen.

    Note that if you change the settings for an exception that is being used by one or
    more schedules, those schedules will also be updated when you click on "Save changes."

    If you wish to create a new exception, you must click on "Add altered opening hours"
    or "Add closed days" at the top of the list of exceptions. This opens an interface
    where you must enter the name and settings for the chosen type of exception. When
    you click on "Create", you will be redirected to the editing interface for the newly
    created exception, where you can continue to edit the settings.
