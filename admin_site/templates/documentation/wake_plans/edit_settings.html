  <h1>{% translate "Editing schedules: Settings" %}</h1>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The editing interface for a schedule shows the settings for the schedule on the left side
    of the screen and a list of exceptions that are used by the schedule on the right side
    of the screen.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h2>{% translate "Status" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    A schedule can be active or inactive. It will only affect the associated
    groups if it is active.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h2>{% translate "Sleep state" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The chosen sleep state determines the state that the members of the schedule are
    placed in when they are turned off according to the schedule. In order from least
    to greatest energy savings, the options are standby, freeze, mem and off. We thus
    recommend using the sleep state off in order to achieve the greatest energy savings,
    but not all hardware supports this sleep state. If the sleep state off is used on
    a computer that does not support it, the computer will not wake automatically.
    It will still be possible to turn it on manually.

  </p>
  <h2>{% translate "Settings: Week plan" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    In the week plan, one can choose on and off times for every day of the week, or
    whether it should be off for the entirety of that particular day. The settings in
    the week plan normally apply for each of those days of the week, unless there
    exists an exception for that particular date.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h2>{% translate "Settings: Exceptions" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    Below the header "Exceptions: Closed days and altered opening hours", one can
    add or remove exceptions to the week plan for specific dates or periods.
    If an exception for a given date exists, the settings for the exception will
    be used instead of the week plan settings.
    An exception can be a change in the on and off times or a constant shutdown
    for a specific date or period.
    Exceptions are created, deleted and edited in the tab that opens when you click
    "Create closed days", "Create altered opening hours" or "Edit exceptions". The
    different buttons redirect to the part of the tab that is related to their name.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h3>{% translate "Add exceptions" %}</h3>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    You add exceptions by clicking on "Add exception to schedule". If there are
    any exceptions that do not yet belong to the schedule, they will be shown in
    a list. Click on the exception(s) that you wish to add to select them and then
    click on the check mark beneath the list to add the exception(s) to the schedule.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    If you attempt to add an exception that overlaps with one or more already added
    exceptions, the chosen exception will be rejected during the update of the
    schedule when you click "Save changes". Valid exceptions will still be added.
    If one or more exceptions are rejected, the page will inform you of this along
    with the reason.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h2>{% translate "Remove exceptions" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    In order to remove an exception, you must click on the X to the right of the
    exception in the list of exceptions.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    Be aware that changes to the settings including the list of exceptions do not become
    permanent until you have clicked on "Save changes" at the bottom of the screen.
