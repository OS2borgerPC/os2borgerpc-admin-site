  <h1>{% translate "Editing schedules: Associated groups" %}</h1>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The editing interface for a schedule shows a list of groups that are
    included in the schedule on the right side of the screen. A schedule
    applies to all computers in the groups that are associated with the
    schedule. A schedule with no associated groups has no effect. You can
    edit the members of the schedule as described below.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h2>{% translate "Add a group" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    You add groups by clicking on "Add group to the schedule". If there are
    any groups that do not yet belong to the schedule, they will be shown in
    a list. Click on a group to add the group to the schedule.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    Note that a given group/computer can only belong to a single schedule at a time.
    If you add a group that already belongs to a different schedule, it will be removed
    from the previous schedule.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    If you attempt to add a group, which contains one or more computers that already
    belong to a different schedule via a different group, the chosen group will
    be rejected during the update of the schedule when you click "Save changes".
    Valid groups will still be added. If one or more groups are rejected, the page
    will inform you of this along with the reason.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h2>{% translate "Remove a group" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    In order to remove a group, you must click on the X to the right of the group
    in the list of associated groups.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    Be aware that changes to the list of groups do not become permanent until
    you have clicked on "Save changes" at the bottom of the screen.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    Note that if you later add computers to a group that belongs to a schedule, those
    computers will also be associated with the schedule. If the computers that you
    attempt to add already belong to a different schedule via a different group, they
    will be rejected during the update of the group when you click "Save changes" on
    the group editing interface. Valid computers will still be added. If one or more
    computers are rejected, the page will inform you of this along with the reason.
