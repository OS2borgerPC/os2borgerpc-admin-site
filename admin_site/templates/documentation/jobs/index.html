    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The job overview provides an overview of the execution of jobs on OS2borgerPC
    computers for the chosen site. On the left, one can choose various filters
    that make the list more manageable, and on the right is shown a list of jobs
    that match the chosen filters.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h2>{% translate "Filters" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    By clicking the checkboxes next to the different statuses, you can filter
    the shown jobs based on their status. By default, all statuses except
    "restarted" are checked.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    Below the checkboxes you can choose filters based on batches, computers
    and groups. In order to use these filters, you must click on the desired
    category and then select an element in the list that is displayed. The
    chosen element will be highlighted in orange. It is only possible to
    select one element per category. You can reset the filters to the default
    filters by clicking "Reset filters" at the top of the list of filters.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <h2>{% translate "The job list" %}</h2>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    The job list shows the script name, batch name, user who started the job,
    creation time, starting time, stopping time, status and computer name for
    every job that matches the chosen filters. The sorting can be changed by
    clicking the titles above the table.
    {% endblocktranslate %}

    If you click on the small icon on the right of an entry in the list, you
    will be shown the log output from that job. If the job has not yet been
    executed, the log output will only contain the chosen input parameters.
    If the job has finished, there will also be a button that you can press in
    order to restart the job (mainly relevant if the job failed).
