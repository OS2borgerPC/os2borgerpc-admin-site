    When you click on "Security Scripts" in the left-hand menu, a list of
    security scripts will be shown to the right of the left-hand menu and
    the editing interface for security scripts will be shown to the right
    of this list.

    Security scripts monitor special events whereas Scripts are for individual actions.

    The list of security scripts is divided in two parts that one can swap between
    by clicking on the tabs "Local scripts" and "Global scripts" above
    the list.
    {% endblocktranslate %}

  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    Local scripts are security scripts that can only be used on the currently chosen
    site while global scripts are security scripts that can be used on all sites.

    If you wish to add a new security script, you must click on "Add new
    Security Script" above the list of security scripts. This will open
    a modal where you can fill out the name and description and upload the
    script code. When you then click on "Create Security Script", the
    script will be created, and you will be redirected to the editing
    interface for the newly created security script.
