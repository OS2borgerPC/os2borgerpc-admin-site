  <h1>{% translate "Events" %}</h1>
  <p>
	{% blocktranslate trimmed %}
	This overview shows the individual events that have been triggered by the system.
	In the left column, you can choose how you wish to filter the overview, i.e.
	choose which events you wish to see. By default, you will be shown all unresolved
	events with a severity level greater than normal.
	The severity level is also shown in the overview.
	{% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>  
  <p>
	{% blocktranslate trimmed %}
	From the overview you can select and handle events. Handling an event
	allows you to change its status and the assigned user as well as add or change
	a note for the event. It is possible to handle multiple events simultaneously.
	{% endblocktranslate %}
  </p>
  <p>
	{% blocktranslate trimmed %}
	The possible statuses are new (the default), assigned and resolved. The assigned
	user can be chosen from among all users on the site you are on. It is possible
	for an event to have no assigned user.
