    The overview "Monitoring Rules" shows all the defined security rules and
    offline rules that are monitored. You can define new security
    rules from the overview by clicking on "Add new security rule" above the
    list of defined rules. You can edit an existing security rule
    by selecting it in the list. The interface for both operations has the
    same form.

      related to the security rule. Note that if a monitored PC belongs to one or more groups with
      supervisors, those supervisors will receive any email warnings related to that PC instead of the
      recipients set here.
