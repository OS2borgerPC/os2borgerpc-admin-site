    In order to run a script on a computer or a group of computers, you must click
    on "Scripts" in the left-hand menu and choose the script you wish to run.
    Note that it may be necessary to swap between the tabs "Local scripts" and
    "Global scripts" in order to find the script. When you have located the script
    you wish to run, you must click on the button "Run script".

    You will now be shown a modal where you will be asked to select the
    computers and/or groups that should execute the script. Click on the
    individual computer or group in order to select/deselect it. You can
    choose any number of computers or groups. At the top are special
    checkboxes that can be used to select/deselect all computers or groups.
    Choosing a group will cause the script to be executed on all computers
    in that group. Click "Next" once you have made your choices.

    You will now be asked to enter input parameters for the script. If an input
    parameter has a default value, it will be entered by default. The value can
    be changed. Fill out the fields and press "Run" in order to start the script
    execution. This will result in a job being created for every computer that
    the script is to be executed on. You can click on the link in the last section
    of the modal in order to jump to
