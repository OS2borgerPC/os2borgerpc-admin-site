    If you wish to edit a Script, you must click on "Scripts" in the left-hand
    menu and then select the script in the list of scripts shown to the right
    of the left-hand menu. Note that it may be necessary to swap between the
    tabs "Local scripts" and "Global scripts" in order to find the script.
    You can also search through the scripts by selecting the search field
    "Find ..." and typing a search term. This will cause the list to display
    all scripts whose names contain the search term.

    When you edit a script you can change its name and description. It is
    also possible to upload a new version of the script by clicking on the
    tab "Code" and then selecting a file to upload. Changes do not become
    permanent until you've clicked on "Save changes" at the bottom of the
    screen.
