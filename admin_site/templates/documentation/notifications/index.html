    Email notifications regarding computers that have been offline for longer
    than a selected period of time are generated by offline rules. If no
    offline rules have been defined, no notifications will be sent.
    {% endblocktranslate %}

    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    When an offline rule detects that a PC has been offline for too long, the
    system will also generate an event for that PC.

    The system will only check the defined offline rules every ten minutes.
    It is thus possible for there to be a delay of up to ten minutes between
    a PC exceeding the allowed offline period and a notification being sent.
    This was necessary to limit the load on the admin-site.

    The overview "Monitoring Rules" shows all the defined security rules and
    offline rules that are monitored. You can edit an existing offline rule
    by selecting it in the list. You can define a new offline rule by clicking
    on "Add new offline rule" above the list. The interface for both operations
    has the same form.

        Monitor period (mandatory): The period during which the rule is active.
        It is recommended to choose this period such that you avoid receiving
        notifications when computers are turned off for the night.
        {% endblocktranslate %}

      <li>
        {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
        Maximum offline period allowed, in minutes (mandatory): The maximum period
        of time that a computer can be offline during the monitor period before
        email notifications are sent. Cannot be less than 15 minutes.
        {% endblocktranslate %}

        Recipient(s) of email warning (optional): The users that should receive email notifications related
        to this offline rule. Note that if a monitored PC belongs to one or more groups with supervisors,
        those supervisors will receive any email notifications related to that PC instead of the
        recipients set here.

    Any changes made to an offline rule will not take effect until you have clicked
    on "Save changes" at the bottom of the screen. Similarly, you must click on
    "Save changes" to finish creating a new offline rule once you have filled out
    the mandatory parameters. You can verify that the offline rule has been created
    by checking if it appears in the list of monitored rules.
