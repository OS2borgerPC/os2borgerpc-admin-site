    You have the option of assigning each group a number of associated scripts. In order to change the
    associated scripts for a group, you must click on the group and then click the tab {{ asc }}. Select
    the input field {{ addsc }} and search for the script that you wish to assign to the group.
    Next, click on the script and it will be added as an Associated Script.
    {% endblocktranslate %}

    When a computer is added to a group, all Associated Scripts are automatically run on that computer.
    When you add a new Associated Script, it will automatically be run on all computers in the group.
    Editing the parameters of an associated script will only cause it to be rerun on the computers
    in the group if the relevant setting under Site settings has been checked.
    {% endblocktranslate %}

    Associated Scripts have a position that determines the order in which they are run and they may have a
    number of input parameters that they are run with.

    Example: There is one computer in the library and another in citizen service that should have different homepages,
    but both be connected to the same scanner. In this case, one computer can be added to the library group and the other
    to the citizen service group while both are added to the group for scanner computers.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
    </p>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    We recommend using Associated Scripts where possible as they make it simpler to set up new computers in
    a department. All you need to do is to add the new computers to the group, and then the relevant scripts
    will automatically be run on them with the correct input parameters.

    <li>{% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      When a script is added to or removed from the list, the change won't be saved until you've clicked {{save}}.
      {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
    <li>{% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      If the added script requires input parameters, these parameters are set by clicking {{edit}} and this {{must}}
      be done before the changes can be saved. I.e. a Script that requires input parameters cannot be assigned with
      empty input parameters.
      {% endblocktranslate %}</li>
    <li>{% blocktranslate trimmed %}
      You can change the input parameters for a script by clicking {{edit}}, making the desired changes and
      then saving the changes. However, this will only cause the script to be rerun on the computers in the
      group if the relevant setting under Site settings has been checked.
