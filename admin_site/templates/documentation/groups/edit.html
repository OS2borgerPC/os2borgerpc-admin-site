  <h3>{% translate "Notice for users of On/Off schedules" %}</h3>
  <p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    A computer can only be associated with a single schedule at a time. If the
    group is associated with a schedule and you add one or more computers that
    are associated with a different schedule via a different group, the chosen
    computers will be rejected as part of the update of the group when you click
    "Save changes". Valid computers will still be added. If one or more computers
    are rejected, the webpage will inform you of this as well as the reason.
