    Once you have installed OS2borgerPC on a computer and registered it with the admin site,
    it will show up on the list of new computers under{% endblocktranslate %}
     <a href="{% url 'doc' 'getting_started' %}">site-status</a>.
    {% translate "Before you can start working with the computer, it is necessary to activate it." %}
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    This is done by clicking on the computer, checking the box "Activated" and then clicking "Save changes".
    Afterward, the computer has been activated. {% endblocktranslate %}

    Except from the registration itself, the admin-site will always ignore all requests from computers
    that have not been activated. This is partially a practical measure (there is no reason to start
    updating a computer before you know that it is ready) and partially a security measure.

    <b>{% translate "Note" %}:</b> {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
    One of the reasons that all computers must be activated manually is to prevent foreign computers
    from connecting to your site without you or your organization knowing.
    As such, you should only activate a computer if you know that it is supposed to be there.
