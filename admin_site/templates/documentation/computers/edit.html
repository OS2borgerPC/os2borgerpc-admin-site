    When you click on a computer, you will by default be shown the computer's
    master data and any group affiliations. Here you can change the computer's
    name and description and activate it if it has not been activated after the
    installation. You can also add or remove group affiliations. You must click
    the button "Save changes" before the changes take effect.

    You add groups by clicking on "Add computer to group". If there are any groups
    that the computer does not yet belong to, they will be shown in a list. Click on
    the group(s) that you wish to add to select them and then click on the check mark
    beneath the list to add the computer to the group(s). You remove a group by clicking on the X
    to the right of the group's name in the list of group affiliations. Remember that
    any changes are not permanent until you've clicked on "Save changes" at the bottom of the screen.
