<h1>{% translate "Sites overview" %}</h1>
    <p>
        {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
            The sites overview shows all the sites that you have access to. A customer admin has access to
            all sites for that customer while other users only have access to the sites that they have been assigned to.
            Customer admins can also delete or create sites from the sites overview.

<h2>{% translate "Deleting a site" %}</h2>
<p>{% translate "REMINDER: Only customer admins can delete a site!" %}</p>
<p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
        To start the process of deleting a site, click the dropdown symbol on the right side of the button
        for that site, and then on "Delete Site".
        Note that if 5 or more computers are registered with the site, the "Delete Site" button will be inactive
        and deletion will not be possible.
        You will then need to manually remove computers from the site for deletion to be possible. The computers
        can be removed via the computers overview for that site.
        After clicking on the "Delete Site" button, you will be redirected to a new page that will inform
        you of the consequences of deleting the site. You must check a checkbox indicating that you understand and
        accept the consequences of deleting the site before you can click "Confirm deletion" to finalize the deletion.

<h2>{% translate "Creating a new site" %}</h2>
<p>{% translate "REMINDER: Only customer admins can create new sites!" %}</p>
<p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
        If you wish to create a new site, you must click on the "Add new site" button, which is only visible
        to customer admins.
        This will open a modal where you must enter a name and a unique UID for the site.
        Note that the UID must be used when registering computers with the site. As such, we suggest choosing values
        like "organization" or "organization-location" (without quotes).
        The modal will indicate whether the chosen UID is unique. If the chosen UID is not unique, the "Create site"
        button in the modal will be inactive.
        When you click on "Create site", you will be returned to the sites overview where it will be possible
        to select the new site.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
</p>
<p>
    {% blocktranslate trimmed %}
        Once you have created a new site, you can create new users for the site or add existing users
        to the site via the "Users" section for that site. See the documentation regarding "Users"
        for more information.
